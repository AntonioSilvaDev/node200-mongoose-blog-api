# Hey There :wave:

In this project, I had to build a REST API for a blog website using Express, using Mongoose to read/write Users and Blogs to a MongoDB database.

## To Start

Clone --> npm install --> start free mLab account and put name and password in .env file (MLAB_ADMIN_NAME, MLAB_PASSWORD) --> npm run dev

### Enjoy :thumbsup:
